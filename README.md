# Introduction
Road traffic accidents (RTAs) represent a significant public health issue in the world, and UK is not an exception, leading to the loss of thousands of lives and numerous severe injuries each year.
In the past 2 years, the country continued to experience a high incidence of accidents nationwide. This report explores the demographic effects and key causes of these incidents, providing
valuable insights for shaping effective road safety interventions and policies. RTAs not only lead to fatalities and serious injuries but also place heavy economic strain on the healthcare system and the overall economy.
Analyzing the trends and causes of these accidents is essential for creating targeted strategies to prevent future occurrences. This comprehensive report seeks to uncover important trends, 
1. What is the total number of road accident casualties recorded?
2. Which type of vehicle is most involved in road accidents?
3. What are the trends in road accident casualties throughout the year?
4. How do weather conditions impact the number of road accidents?
Pinpoint high-risk areas, and offer practical recommendations to enhance road safety throughout the country.
# Purpose
This dashboard's primary purpose is to offer stakeholders such as traffic management authorities, urban planners, and policymakers valuable insights into the factors contributing to road accidents.
This information can be used to develop strategies to reduce the occurrence of accidents and improve overall road safety.

# Documentation 
Overview
This project presents a comprehensive dashboard that visualizes road accident data, providing insights into various aspects of road safety.
The dashboard focuses on different metrics such as the total number of casualties, types of vehicles involved, road types with the most accidents,and monthly trends in road accident occurrences.
# This Analysis Features
1. Total Casualties Overview: The dashboard displays a clear breakdown of total casualties, including fatal, serious, and slight injuries, allowing for an immediate understanding of the severity of road accidents.
2. Vehicle Type Analysis: This section of the dashboard shows which types of vehicles (e.g., cars, vans, buses, bikes, etc.) are most frequently involved in accidents.
3. Road Type Casualties: An analysis of which road types (e.g., single carriageway, dual carriageway) see the highest number of accidents.
4. Monthly Trends: The dashboard provides a trend analysis showing the number of accidents each month, highlighting periods with spikes or declines in accident rates.
5. Weather Conditions Impact: Visualization of how different weather conditions (e.g., dry, wet, snow/ice) affect the number of road accidents.
6. Recommendations: Based on the data, the dashboard suggests recommendations aimed at reducing road accidents, and making the roads safer for all users.

# Data Sources
The data used in this dashboard was sourced from publicly available road accident datasets for the years 2021 and 2022. This includes information on casualties, vehicle types, road types, and weather conditions at the time of accidents.
